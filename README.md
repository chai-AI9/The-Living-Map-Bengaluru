# The Living Map of Bengaluru 🌆

A personal data science project exploring:
- 🌳 Green cover and tree density across wards
- 🚌 BMTC accessibility for job-seekers and students
- 🌧️ How rain impacts everyday life (commute, food delivery, etc.)

# 🌱 The Living Map: Green Coverage in Bengaluru

A personal data science project visualizing green spaces across BBMP wards in Bengaluru using geospatial analysis and machine learning concepts.

---

## 🔍 Overview

This project aims to:
- Visualize ward-level boundaries of Bengaluru
- Simulate and map a "Green Index" to represent tree/park density
- Explore the potential for spatial clustering and environmental health analytics
- Set the foundation for integrating real-world sustainability data (e.g., tree counts, AQI, water consumption)

---

## 📌 Tools & Libraries Used

- `GeoPandas` – Geospatial data processing
- `Folium` – Interactive mapping
- `Matplotlib` – Static map visualization
- `NumPy` – Data simulation (green index)
- `Shapely` – Geometry handling

---

- Future modules: Reinforcement Learning (for transit optimization)

## Roadmap
- ✅ Module 1: Green Cover Analysis
- ⏳ Module 2: BMTC Access Score
- ⏳ Module 3: Rainwatch Diaries
